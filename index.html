                <p>Dante refers to the first circle of Hell as Limbo (from the Latin word limbus, meaning “edge” or “border”). It is the home of souls who lived good, sinless lives; however, they were unbaptized, and are therefore unable to dwell in Heaven. The living conditions aren’t bad, but the souls who reside there must spend eternity outside of the presence of God. It is the home of Virgil himself, as well as Homer, Horace, Ovid, Socrates, Plato, Saladin, and many others.</p>

                <p>The second circle of Hell is reserved for those who acted upon their lustful desires during their mortal lives. Dante describes the setting as dark and windy. The sinners are eternally blown in the wind: helpless, shrieking, and cold. Two souls catch Dante’s attention and introduce themselves as Paolo and Francesca. They tell Dante their forbidden love story, causing him to weep and faint from emotion.</p>

                <p>The third circle of Hell is reserved for the gluttonous, or those who indulged in food and drink in excess. The sinners are condemned to endure an eternity of icy rain as they wallow in a stinking, cold slush. Simultaneously, Cerberus, a three-headed dog, constantly barks to the annoyance of the sinners. He also claws and bites them. One particular sinner introduces himself to Dante as Ciacco - which translates to “pig” in Italian. He claims to also be from Florence and Dante feels sorry for his fate.</p>

                <p>The fourth circle of Hell is for those who were ill-advised with their wealth. Both incorrect monetary philosophies are punished here, including those who hoard money and those who spend it in excess. Their eternal punishment is that they have to roll giant weights in a circle until they collide and then shout at each other about their opposing monetary views. They then repeat this seemingly useless task over and over again.</p>

                <p>The fifth circle of Hell is reserved for those who display anger in two ways: by wrath and by sulleness. The wrathful, those who were overcome by intense anger, are condemned to fight each other in the swamp-like river Styx. At the same time, the sullen (gloomy) souls are almost fully submerged in the river, choking on the mud. Dante and Virgil watch these sinners in a boat controlled by Phlegyas. While traveling, Dante encounters his political enemy, Filippo Argenti, and wishes him further punishment.</p>

                <p>The sixth circle of Hell is reserved for heretics, which are people who hold beliefs contrary to traditional Christian values. Their punishment is an eternity inside of a fiery tomb. Dante refers to two souls in particular: Farinata degli Uberti, a political leader from Florence who opposed the church, and Cavalcante de’ Cavalcanti, a family friend of Dante’s who was associated with an unorthodox faction.</p>

                <h2 style="line-height: 0;">Violence</h2>
                <p>The seventh circle is reserved for the sin of violence. It is further divided into three sections, based on the type of violence a sinner committed during their life. The outermost ring is for those who were violent towards others. Their punishment is that they are immersed in a boiling river of blood and fire. The middle ring is for those who committed violence against themselves, and these souls are transformed into gnarled trees. The innermost ring is for souls who were violent against God, art, or nature. The landscape is a field of burning sand with fire raining from the sky.</p>

                <h2 style="line-height: 0;">Fraud</h2>
                <p>The eighth circle of Hell is for those who committed fraud during their lives. It is a pit divided into ten different trenches, each reserved for a different type of fraud. The first trench is for panders and seducers, who are whipped by demons. The second is for flatterers, who are covered in human waste. The third trench is for simonists; they are placed upside down in holes with their feet set on fire. In the fourth trench, false prophets’ heads are twisted backward. The fifth trench is reserved for corrupt politicians, who are submerged in a lake of boiling pitch. The sixth trench is for hypocrites; they are forced to wear heavy cloaks. The seventh trench is for thieves, who are bitten by snakes, causing them to turn into snakes themselves. In the eighth trench, deceitful counselors suffer in flames. The ninth trench is for sowers of discord, who are mutilated by demons. The tenth and final ditch is for falsifiers, who eternally suffer from various diseases.</p>

                <p>The ninth and final circle of Hell punishes the sin of treachery--people who were traitors during their mortal lives. The setting of this circle is a frozen lake called Cocytus, which is further divided into four sections, each containing a different type of traitor. The first section punishes traitors against family, the second against their country, the third against guests, and the fourth against masters. The sinners are submerged in the frozen lake. In the very center is Lucifer himself, who is portrayed with three faces, each chewing on a different traitor: Judas, Brutus, and Cassius.</p>
